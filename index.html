            <p>When I got out, I enjoyed the first ray of the morning. The place was a bazaar. I could see residential
                hotels, restaurants, shops, bus counters, mosques, and people. There were also a handful of jeeps
                waiting to
                take the passengers to Sajek. My immediate intention was to find a toilet. I found it difficult,
                unfortunately. I was on the verge of embarrassment. Suddenly I noticed one. I stormed into it and spent
                some
                time there. The next mission was to satisfy my endless appetites. A rather simple task for me – I took
                omelets, parathas, and teas. </p>
